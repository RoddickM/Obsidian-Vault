Data is simply raw numbers and letters that is collected through a variety of methods e.g., surveys. Data is an objective value and cannot be changed (if collected correctly) as they represent the unfiltered result of collecting it.

Data has no meaning and is processed, meaning that it has not been changed and does not tell us anything about the what the numbers and values represent.
