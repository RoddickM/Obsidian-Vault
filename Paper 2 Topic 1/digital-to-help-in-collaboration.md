When talking about collaboration, we can range this from small team or one-on-one meetings to larger meetings with members from multiple departments. Technology allows colaboration to be done from any location and time due making it online instead of face-to-face. Software such as MS Teams and Discord are two examples of collaboration tools used within businesses. Furthermore, these collaboration applications can employ the use of bots, which are AI/Programs that can automatially do tasks, which can used within an organisation to do mundane tasks.
