When before a digital project can be planned, we must first find out how feasible the project is. The factors that determines the feasibility of a project are:
- Benefits - what can be gained from the project
- Drawbacks - what might be the downsides of the projects
- Risks - what might cause the project to not be completed
- Constraints - what might limit the project from being fully completed
- Dependencies - tasks that must be completed before the project can move on
